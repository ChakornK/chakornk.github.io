MasterMath is a project built at Stormhacks 2025, a 24-hour hackathon, in collaboration with [@noknight12](https://github.com/noknight12), [@maneetdhaliwal](https://github.com/maneetdhaliwal), and [@ricd99](https://github.com/ricd99). Its main goal is to help users practice math in a more engaging way through a streak system and a playful, interactive UI.

MongoDB is used to store user data and track their progress, which is then used to display data on their dashboard.
