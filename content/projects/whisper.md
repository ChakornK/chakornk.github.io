Whisper is a project built at Journeyhacks 2026, an 8-hour hackathon, in collaboration with [@galileokim](https://github.com/galileokim), [@maneetdhaliwal](https://github.com/maneetdhaliwal), and [@tommyxie0stu](https://github.com/tommyxie0stu). It is an anonymous confession platform that allows users to share their thoughts and feelings with their local community.

## Inspiration

We wanted to recreate the addictive culture of anonymous confession pages, but make it feel more real, immediate, and personal. Instead of random anonymous posts from anywhere, we wanted a feed that feels like it’s coming from people around you, without exposing identities.

## Features

Whisper is a dark, anonymous confession app where users post thoughts they’d never say out loud. Confessions are gated by proximity radius, making posts feel personal without turning into stalking.

Posts disappear after a set amount of time, but the more popular they are (determined by number of likes), the longer they stay, so only the most relatable or insane secrets survive.

Whisper has a responsive UI design, meaning it still looks good on smaller mobile screens.
