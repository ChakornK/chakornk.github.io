At my high school, clubs were tracked using a spreadsheet, which made it difficult to keep track of all information for each club. Updating information for a club was a manual process that relied on a person with access to the spreadsheet. Furthermore, there was no central location for all club information, making it difficult to find what you were looking for.

Together with [@maneetdhaliwal](https://github.com/maneetdhaliwal), we created Club Manager, a web application for managing school clubs. It centralizes all club information in one place, making it easier to update and find what you were looking for.

The application features a discovery page for all clubs, which allows students to easily browse through all clubs and see what they have been up to.

Each club has its own page, which allows users to view the club's information.

Club owners can easily update their club's information through the application.
