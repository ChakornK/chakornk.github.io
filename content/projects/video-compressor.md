Video Compressor is a mobile app that uses FFmpeg to compress video files. It allows users to select a video file and specify the target file size and video dimensions. The app then uses FFmpeg to compress the video file and save it to the user's device. Unlike most video compressors, which require the user to upload their file to be processed on a web server, Video Compressor compresses the file directly on the user's device.
