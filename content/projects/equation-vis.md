Equation Visualizer is a web application that allows users to visualize math equations as a heatmap by showing how close a point on the real plane is to the given curve. The application allows users to input an equation, which is then parsed by mathjs, and rendered on the canvas. It uses WebGL to quickly compute the heatmap, making it fast and responsive.
