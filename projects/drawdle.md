Drawdle allows users to learn basic drawing skills by following video tutorials and practicing on a canvas. This project was created in collaboration with [@TheUnicat](https://github.com/TheUnicat) and [@danburgerisaburger](https://github.com/danburgerisaburger).

The application features a practice canvas and a sidebar for watching video tutorials. Users can also save their current drawing, which can be restored later.
